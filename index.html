            <p>goals ↓</p>
            <p>craftili is an online marketplace for customizable products. The client’s approach prioritized humanizing online transactions, bridging the gap between creator and consumer.
              My aim was to design a landing page that explained the platform’s features and goals while maintaining accessibility. This page would be active prior to and during the launch of the platform.
            </p>
            <br>

            <p>process ↓</p>
            <p>Bespoke items are typically associated with affluence and thus exclusivity, so it was important that the design not come across as too cold or luxurious. At the same time, I was aware that the target demographic would be a ‘hip’
              crowd
              whose sensibilities would not be catered to by existing cookie-cutter retailers. With this in mind, I ensured that the design was modern, clean, and neutral. I figured that the featured sellers on the site would be apt appeal to the
              fringe
              interests of potential users (the sellers are not pictured in the displays above), and that an understated design would do best for a marketplace-style platform.
              Because the core concept of the platform is not radically new, my approach to novel appeal relied more on visual tactics. This is why I decided to employ a video background. It is both optically stimulating, and also conveys the
              company’s
              emphasis on humanity and craftsmanship. I stitched together a montage of stock photos to send to the client, and then remotely directed the filming process of the actual featured clients. Similarly, I implemented parallax motion on
              scroll.

            <p>overview ↓</p>
            <p>I was tasked with redesigning the website and branding for the STEM transfer community at UCLA. I worked with the existing site, which was hosted on WIX, to improve the user experience and to modernize the org’s visual identity.
              <p />
              <br>

            <p>process ↓</p>
            <p>There were two constraints I worked under: I was required to keep the website on WIX, and I had to adhere to UCLA’s branding principles. The former made the process easier, as I enjoy designing with limitations and adapting an old
              aesthetic into a new form. This was not the case for the latter; I found that WIX as a site builder presented limitations in areas I did not appreciate- I found myself unable to flexibly design the site structure and found that I
              couldn't exactly implement the UX system I had in mind for the organization.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>note ↓</p>
            <p>I also created graphics for various social media accounts, and redesigned the org's logos using typefaces from velvetyne.</p>
